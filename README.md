I created the fictional Berkeley Classic Vehicles website website with HTML/CSS and PHP. The website is for employees to help their customers with the purchase of classic vehicles.  It involves the creation of forms, storage of form data in the database, use of data from databases, and web application security. A username and password would need to be created to see the entire website.
